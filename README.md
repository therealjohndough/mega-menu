# Mega Menu Template

This repository contains a simple mega menu inspired by the navigation design used on [Designlab](https://designlab.com/blog/examples-brutalism-in-web-design). It demonstrates a multi-column dropdown menu with basic styling.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser to see the menu in action. The menu is styled with `styles.css` and uses only CSS for hover interactions.
